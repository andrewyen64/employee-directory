## Description

An employee directory react application that loads a table filled with non-sensitive data on employees. This app uses data from the Random User Generator API to view the image, name, phone number, email, and DOB of several employees. You can search an employee by their first name with the search bar and also order them by name from A-Z by clicking on the "Name" column.
